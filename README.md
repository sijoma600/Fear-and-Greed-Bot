# Fear-and-Greed-Bot

 The Cryptocurrency Fear and Greed Index is a number that displays the current
 sentiment towards Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The number ranges from 0-100, as 0 being
 extreme fear and 100 being extreme greed. Extreme fear can be a sign that investors are too worried.
 That could be a buying opportunity. When Investors are getting too greedy, that means the market
 is due for a correction.
 
 The website "https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/" calculates and posts the
